# SK
2d top-down interactive game, inspired by Undertale.
## First Floor:
* Esriel wakes up with little no to memories to a bright room filled with decorations in celebration of their selection (Esriel’s gender is unknown so they/them pronouns are used) 
* Interact with various other characters that all congratulate Esriel 
* Finds notes and drawings of depictions of “the loop” or infinity symbol drawn over and over - foreshadowing that is unclear at first.
* TV. shows only static in the corner of the room and the mirror appears normal
* Stuffed bear found on the floor requests that Esriel retrieve their missing parts hidden around the rooms (they ask for their arm and their eye, but MC is only able to find the arm for now)
* Finding and stitching the bear’s arm allows progression and Esriel is now carrying the bear with them to the next level 
## Hallway:
* Three clocks are lined along the walls of the hallway - all displaying different times 
* The bear follows close behind you and mirrors your movements 
* Some dialogue between them
